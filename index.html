				New York City as in life, all roads are done, let me say: "it doesnt matter what you try.."It is no shortcut to The Bronx". Clearly, life have been resistant...alone in the world. No one recently scaped from tears.  I am still tangled ...plagued by delays and frauds. It hasn't been easy for anyone. Vampires are well known as predictors, day by day as time runs. You may feel overwhelmed and that you are unable to accomplish all the things your dream of. My alternative: Faith! Gratitud everyday for what I have and for all of you. I CAN'T STOP DREAMING OF THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD: The brightest days will come... being late in my dreams...oh YES. Maybe it is telling me that it is better to be late than never.

				As a survivor of the Sandy Huracan. I am here to advocate for help.  UNITED IN HARMONY, We will rebuild NYC. Lets us STAND taller from our disasters and chaos.

				Let me try to invite HERE, our exemplary guesses of our society and authorities! 
				We need their support...
